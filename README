Welcome!

This is Alicia's compilation of all files sent to Portia for learning ROOT, Hall C, etc.
Files are split up into steps labelled by week, with the focus each week being:

1. Intro to ROOT - macro structure, running from terminal, very basic macros
2. Data in ROOT - manipulating graphs, histograms, and functions
3. Intro to TTrees - how to create a TTree and how to read data from a TTree
4. KaonLT data - manipulating our specific data set

I will continue to update as we progress during the summer.
Files may be added by Ali or Portia as well.
