There's a bit of nuance to how to draw a branch from a tree
You likely want to play with this live in a root session first
Then write a macro for this only once you know what task you want to do

tree->Print(); //this shows what branches are in the tree

tree->Draw("branch"); //draw a histogram of a branch from a tree
eg: Cut_Pion_Events_Prompt_Pos->Draw("P_hgcer_npeSum");
eg2: CDATA->Draw("q_energy");

tree->Draw("branch>>h1"); //draw the branch into a histogram named h1

tree->Draw("branch1:branch2"); //draw a 2D histogram comparing two tree branches

//draw two different branches on top of each other:
tree->Draw("branch1");
tree->Draw("branch1","","same");

//draw a branch but only for events with a condition satisfied
tree->Draw("branch1","branch2>0");

//control what the axis limits of the drawn histogram will be
tree->Draw("branch1>>h1(100,0,1)");

//using all 3 arguments: colz is a nice drawing option
tree->Draw("branch1:branch2","branch3>4","colz");
